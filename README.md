🔢 Data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis; predictive modeling  

I am a current student in the [Master of Science in Analytics](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/analytics/) program at Northwestern University, graduating in December 2020. I'm looking for data science or data analysis roles and I am particularly interested in working on government or nonprofit (or related consulting) contexts. Before pivoting to data science, my professional work experience was in software quality assurance and higher education project management.
